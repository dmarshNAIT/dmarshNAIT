## .JPG / .JPEG ##
+ .JPEG is an initialism/acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group.
+ Every time you save a .JPG, it gets **compressed**. 
+ Compression is a way of removing data so that the resulting file size is smaller.
+ In Photoshop, we can actually control the amount of compression that the export process uses. 
+ .JPGs are great for most photos; however, they will **always be rendered as a rectangle**.
+ They also **do not support transparency or animation**.

## .PNG ##
+ Portable Network Graphics (PNGs) have less compression than JPGs.
+ This means that they can be higher quality, but also **larger file sizes**.
+ .PNGs can also have **transparency**.
+ This comes in handy for things like icons, avatars, or something that you might want to render as an ellipse. 

## GIF ##
+ The Graphic Interchange Format (.GIF) is one of the most ubiquitous formats on the web.
+ This file format supports multiple frames â€” that is to say, it **supports animation**.
+ Animated .GIFs can be played once, or on a loop.
+ However, it only supports 8-bit images (i.e. a palette of **256 or fewer colours**). 
+ It also allows for one transparent colour. This is great for things like logos, text, or simple cartoons.
