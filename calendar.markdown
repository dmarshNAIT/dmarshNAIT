Please use [my booking tool](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/8b9412eb8c4241f3839769114dee8cc5@nait.ca) to set up a meeting outside of scheduled class times.
* Occasionally this link breaks for reasons I haven't yet diagnosed: if that's the case, please feel free to send me a regular calendar link for an appropriate length of time at a time I appear to be available. If you open Teams & start a chat with me there is a button called "Schedule a meeting" at the bottom of the screen.

Outside of **emergency situations**, I generally do not honour same-day requests to meet.

Please include:
* your name
* your class section (e.g. A04)
* what you'd like to discuss in our office hour (e.g. specific concepts, an assessment, feedback you received, etc)
