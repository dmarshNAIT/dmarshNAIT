**Cascading Style Sheets** are how we tell the browser how everything should look. 

They're a set of rules that we write to help with **layout** and **style**.

**Cascading** means that if there are multiple styles applied to an element, the **last rule applied** will be the one that's used.

Here's what a bit of CSS can look like:
```css
p {
    color: red;
}
``` 
This means: *in each paragraph, set the color to red (i.e. change the colour of the font).*

+ `p` is an example of a **selector**: the thing we want to change.
+ `color` is an example of a **property**: the type of style we want to change.
+ `red` is an example of a **value**: what we want to set that property to.
+ The combination of `property: value;` is called a declaration.
+ We can have 1 or more declarations per selector.

We can leave comments in CSS like this:
```css
/* This is a comment for humans */
```
This doesn't appear anywhere on the page, and is meant for people reading the source code.

## How to use CSS
We have 3 options: linking, embedding, or inline styles.
1. **Linking** is the recommended way. It's when we link to an external stylesheet, by including something like this in the `<head>` of our HTML document:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
    ```
    where `styles.css` contains the CSS for our site.
1. **Embedding** is the next-best way. That's when we add something like this to the `<head>` of our HTML document:
    ```html
    <style>
        p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
    ```
1. **In-line styles** is the worst way and we won't do it. If we did, it would look like:
    ```html
    <p style="color:red;">Donâ€™t do this.</p>
    ```

## Types of Selectors
+ **Element selectors**. That's when we target `<p>` or `<body>` or any of the other HTML elements we've learned.

+ A **multiple element selector** is when we target multiple elements with the same declaration(s). For example, this will make both my 1st and 2nd level headings blue, by listing all the elements I want to select, separated by commas:
    ```css
    h1, h2 {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```
+ **IDs**. We won't be using them for CSS in this class, but they look like this: `#jumbotron`

+ **Class selectors** are selectors we make up. In CSS, they'll have a dot in their name:
    ```css
    .container {
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    ```
    And we refer to them in HTML using the `class` attribute:
    ```html
    <div class="container">...</div>
    ```
    If an element has multiple classes applied to it in HTML, they are separated by spaces:
    ```html
    <div class="class-one class-two">...</div>
    <!-- these are terrible class names btw -->
    ```
    Class names should be lowercase and use dashes or underscores if their name contains more than one word. Names should be meaningful.
+ I can also combine element and class selectors. This CSS:
    ```css
    p.red-text {
        font-size: 56px;
    }
    ```
    specifically targets paragraphs with the `red-text` class applied. Other paragraphs, and  other HTML elements with the `red-text` class applied, will **not** be affected by this declaration.

+ **Descendant selectors** are when we use an element's location in the DOM to target it. We write it with a space between each element:
    ```css
    header h2 {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```
    This will only target `<h2>` tags that are in the `<header>`.
+ A **descendant combinator** combines these ideas. This:
    ```css
     ul.my-things li {
        color: blue;
    }
    ```
    targets `<li>` that are in an `<ul>` but only if that `<ul>` has the `my-things` class applied to it. Let's look at HTML to see what will be targeted:
    ```html
    <ul class="my-things">
        <li>One</li> <!-- this will be blue -->
        <li>Two</li> <!-- this will be blue -->
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>One</li> <!-- this will not -->
        <li class="my-things">Two</li> <!--  neither will this -->
    </ul>
    ```
+ **Pseudo-class selectors** target an element based on their current state. A few we've covered in class:
    + `a:hover` targets links when we mouse over them.
    + `a:visited` targets links that have already been visited.
    + `a:active` targets links *while* you are clicking them.
    + `a:link` targets links that have not yet been visited.
    + `:nth-child()` targets an element based on its position within its group of siblings.
        + `nth-child(7)` targets the 7th element
        + `li:nth-child(2)` targets the 2nd `<li>` in a list
        + `:nth-child(4n)` targets every 4th element
        + `tr:nth-child(odd)` targets odd rows of a `<table>`
            + *Learn more on the [:nth-child() page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child).*

+ The **universal selector** selects *everything*. It's also the weakest selector with a specificity value of 0.

## Specificity
If rules applied to different elements contradict each other, which one wins?

The most **specific** rule wins. The specificity weighting depends on the kind of selector:

Selector | Example | Specificity of Example
-- | -- | --
Element | `p, h1, h2` | 1
Descendant | `ul li a` | 3
Class | `body.container-960px` | 11
Descendant Combinator | `ul.my-things li` | 12
ID | `#jumbotron` | 100
`!important` | `p { color: red !important; }` | 101

## The Box Model
Everything on our page is rendered as a box, with 4 parts:
1. The **content**
1. A **border**
1. Space *between* the content and the border, called **padding**
1. Space *outside* the border, called **margin**

[More on the box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) on MDN.

We will need to make sure that the total width of all the content, `border`, `padding`, and `margin`s within our page add up to a total width of *exactly* 960px.

### Border
By default, has a `width` of 0. In addition to `width` we can also control its `style` and `color`.
```css
border-width: 2px;
border-style: dashed;
border-color: olive;
```
is the same as
```css
border: 2px dashed olive;
```

### Margin
This is how we move things around on our page.
We can control the `margin` on each side of the box individually:
```css
margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px; 
/* The order is top, right, bottom, left... start at the top then go around clock-wise. */
/* If you don't specify left, it'll be the same as right. */
/* If you don't specify bottom, it'll be the same as top. */
/* If you don't specify right, it'll be the same as top. */
```
Sometimes adjacent elements will essentially "share" their margin. This is called margin collapsing, and means we can't always just add together margins to figure out how much space they take up. More on this phenomenon is available on [this page on mastering_margin_collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing).

### Padding
This is how we increase the space inside an element.
Just like `margin` and `border`, we can control each side individually. The same 'round-the-clock rules apply.


## Display Properties
Every element has a default `display` property (e.g. `<div>` is `block`-level, `<span>` is `inline`). We can change that property with the following declarations in CSS:
```css
display: block;
```
or
```css
display: inline;
```
or
```css
display: inline-block;
```
This can be useful if we want to set the `height` and `width` of an element that is normally `inline`, or we want an element that is normally `block` to show up on the same line as another element: we can just change their `display` property!

## Flexbox
The **CSS Flexible Box Layout Model** is a way to order, align, and lay out website content.

To get items to be in the same flexbox (i.e. on the same line) we apply this to their **parent**:
```css
  display: flex;
```
The parent becomes the **flex container** and the children become **flex items**.

There are a ton of other properties for Flexbox, but we'll only require one other in this course:
```css
flex-wrap: wrap;
```
Just like turning on word-wrap in a text editor means that lines will `wrap` onto the next line if there isn't room for them, adding `flex-wrap: wrap;` to a container lets items in that `flex` container `wrap` onto the next line.

Some "bonus" content:
+ Adding `justify-content: center;` to a flex-container centers items along the *main* axis of the container. If your container contains items that are side-by-side, this means it *horizontally* centers them, rather than the left where they'd "normally" sit.
+ Adding `align-items: center;` to a flex-container will center items along the *cross* axis of the container. If your items are side-by-side, this means it'll *vertically* center them, rather than putting them at the the top or bottom.
+ There are helpful examples of both in this [complete guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
