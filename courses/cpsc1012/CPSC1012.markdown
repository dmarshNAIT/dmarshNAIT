## Miscellanea

### To compile & run a C# program w/o Visual Studio

1. Open up a **Command Prompt**.
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the location of the `.cs` file.
3. Run the command ```csc MyFile.cs``` (where _MyFile.cs_ is the name of your .cs file) to compile the file. This will create an executable file called _MyFile.exe_, which we can run by typing ```MyFile.exe```.

### Code Samples from class
